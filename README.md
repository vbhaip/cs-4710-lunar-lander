# CS 4710 Bipedal Walker Project

This project was completed for CS 4710. We evaluated two reinforcement learning techniques to Open AI's Gym environment [Lunar Lander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/). To see how the environment looks like with a random agent, run `main.py`. The two techniques we explored were a Deep Q Network and a Double Deep Q Network, which can be found in `dqn.py` and `ddqn.py`, respectively.
